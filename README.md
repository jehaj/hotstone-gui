# hotstone-gui
Hopefully implementation agnostic support for hotstone. So I hope it will support the versions
- standard Java
- rust
- go

I am currently working on the rust version so that is the focus.

# Running
I am using vite with no framework and TypeScript. First
```bash
pnpm install
```
or whatever you want. Then
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
and visit the page.
